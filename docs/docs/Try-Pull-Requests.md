# How to Try Out Different Pull Requests and Comment

## How to Try Out Different Pull Requests

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Fork the [coleam00/bolt.new-any-llm](https://github.com/coleam00/bolt.new-any-llm) repository to your GitHub account.
   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bolt.new-any-llm.git
     cd bolt.new-any-llm
     ```

2. **Add the Original Repository as Upstream:**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/coleam00/bolt.new-any-llm.git
   git fetch upstream
   ```

3. **Check Out a Pull Request:**
   - Fetch all pull requests:
     ```bash
     git fetch upstream pull/<PR-number>/head:pr-<PR-number>
     ```
   - For example, to test Pull Request #42:
     ```bash
     git fetch upstream pull/42/head:pr-42
     ```
   - Check out the pull request branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout pr-42
     ```

4. **Test the Changes:**
   - Follow the instructions in the repository’s README or the specific PR description to test the changes.
   - Run any relevant tests or verify functionality.

5. **Provide Feedback:**
   - Go to the pull request page on GitHub.
   - Add a comment detailing:
     - **What works or doesn’t work.**
     - **Steps you took to test.**
     - **Environment details:**
       - Operating System: (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04, Windows 11, macOS Ventura)
	   - Browser: Chrome, FireFox
       - Node.js (if applicable).
       - ollama env and version (if relevant).
     - Example comment:
       ```

## Commenting on Validation of PR Titles

1. **Ensure Title Matches the Pattern:**
   - The PR title must start with a lowercase character and match one of these types:
     - `fix`
     - `feat`
     - `chore`
     - `build`
     - `ci`
     - `perf`
     - `docs`
     - `refactor`
     - `revert`
     - `test`
   - Example of a valid title: `feat: add authentication support`.

2. **Validate the Title Automatically:**
   - When you open or edit a PR, the `Semantic Pull Request` GitHub Action will check the title.
   - If the title is invalid, a message will appear in the PR conversation, specifying the error.

3. **Update the Title:**
   - If the title doesn’t pass validation, edit it to match the required pattern.

## Providing Feedback on the GitHub Action

- Add a comment in the PR about whether the action correctly validated the title:
  - **Positive feedback example:**
    ```
    The GitHub Action successfully validated the PR title. The error message is clear and helpful.
    ```
  - **Negative feedback example:**
    ```
    The GitHub Action flagged the title incorrectly. The title "feat: Initial setup" follows the pattern but was marked as invalid.
    ```

By following this process, you can effectively test pull requests and contribute meaningful feedback to the coleam00/bolt.new-any-llm project.
