## 2. **Issue Description**
In the issue description, you must include all necessary details. Make sure to:
- Provide a **clear explanation** of the issue.
- **Reproduce steps** (if it's a bug or behavior request).
- Include **expected behavior** and **actual behavior** (for bugs).
- Specify **your environment**:
  - **OS**: Windows, Linux, MacOS

### Example:
